## üîç Web Search Feature

The web search feature uses SearXNG to provide AI responses with real web data and citations:

1. **Set up SearXNG** (one-time setup)

   ```bash
   cd sxng
   python3 run.py
   ```

2. **Use web search in chat**

   ```bash
   User: !w what is the latest news about AI?
   ```

3. **Features**
   - IEEE citation format in responses
   - Up to 8 search results per query
   - Automatic JSON format configuration
   - References section with URLs

## üí° Example Sessions

### Basic Chat

```bash
$ ./cha-go
Chatting with OPENAI Model: gpt-4o-mini
User: Hello, how are you?
Hello! I'm doing well, thank you for asking. How can I help you today?

User: !sm
# fzf interface appears to select model

User: !p groq
# Switches to Groq platform and shows model selection
```

### Direct Query Mode

```bash
$ ./cha-go -p anthropic "explain machine learning"
# Gets response from Claude model without entering interactive mode

$ echo "what is 2+2?" | ./cha-go -p groq
# Uses pipe input with Groq platform
```

### Web Search

```bash
User: !w current weather in Tokyo
# Searches web for Tokyo weather and provides AI response with citations

The current weather in Tokyo shows partly cloudy conditions with temperatures
around 15¬∞C (59¬∞F) [1]. According to recent weather data, there's a 20% chance
of rain with light winds from the northeast [2].

```

### Terminal Input Mode

```bash
User: !t
# Opens your preferred editor (default: hx) for multi-line input
# Write your message, save and close
> This is a longer message
> that spans multiple lines
> with complex formatting
[AI response appears here]
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Default Settings

- **Default platform**: OpenAI
- **Default model**: gpt-4o-mini
- **Preferred editor**: hx (for terminal input mode)
- **System prompt**: "You are a helpful assistant powered by a simple Go chat client. Be concise, clear, and accurate."

### Environment Variables

All API keys are loaded from environment variables. Set only the ones for platforms you plan to use.

### SearXNG Configuration

The SearXNG setup script automatically:

- Creates Docker configuration
- Enables JSON format for API access
- Handles first-time setup
- Provides error handling and recovery

## üèó Architecture

### Special Features

- **Reasoning Model Detection**: Automatically detects reasoning models (o1, o3) and provides loading animations instead of streaming
- **Terminal Detection**: Behaves differently when run in terminal vs piped input
- **Color-coded Output**: Uses ANSI colors for better readability
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with informative messages
- **Session Management**: Maintains context and history throughout session

## ü§ù Dependencies

### Go Dependencies

- `github.com/sashabaranov/go-openai` - OpenAI API client
- `github.com/google/uuid` - UUID generation for exports

### External Tools

- `fzf` - Fuzzy finder for interactive selection
- `docker` - For SearXNG web search functionality

### Optional Dependencies

- `python3` and `PyYAML` - For SearXNG setup automation

## üìù Notes

- **Streaming Responses**: All platforms support real-time streaming except reasoning models
- **Cross-platform**: Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows
- **Memory Efficient**: Maintains conversation context without excessive memory usage
- **Error Recovery**: Handles network issues and API errors gracefully
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new AI platforms following the existing pattern

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Key not found**: Make sure environment variables are set correctly
2. **fzf not found**: Install fzf using your package manager
3. **SearXNG not working**: Ensure Docker is running and run `python3 run.py` in sxng directory
4. **Platform switching fails**: Verify API keys for target platform are set

### Web Search Issues

1. **JSON format errors**: Run the SearXNG setup script again
2. **Container conflicts**: Stop existing containers with `docker stop searxng-search`
3. **Permission issues**: Ensure Docker has proper permissions

For more detailed troubleshooting, check the logs or run with verbose flags.
